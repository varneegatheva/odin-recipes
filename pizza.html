    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>This easy pasta recipe is my go-to dinner when there’s no time to cook. In Italy, it’s known as pasta aglio e olio, which means pasta with olive oil and garlic. A few simple ingredients like spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan are all you need!</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <h4>
        <p>2 ounces Spaghetti</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
        <p>1 garlic clove, chopped</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</p>
        <p>ground black pepper</p>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Toss in the spaghetti and cook until al dente.
        </p>
        <p>While the pasta is cooking, warm the olive oil over medium low heat. Add in the garlic and let it cook until soft and golden (you may need to lower the heat to keep it from browning too fast).
        </p>
        <p>Once the spaghetti is cooked drain it while reserving about 1 tablespoons of the starchy pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the pan with the oil and garlic. Toss the pasta around until it’s coated (this is where you can add in the starchy pasta water to keep the pasta moist if it looks too dry).
        </p>
        <p>Add in the parsley and grated cheese, toss to combine and serve.
        </p>
